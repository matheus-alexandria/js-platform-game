## Creating a Platform Game

This project is done as part of the Eloquent JavaScript book, I'm creating it as it's created at the book but with some differences, be on some gameplay element or in using TypeScript.

To run the game use the build command:
```
npm run build
```
Then open the `index.html` and play!
